The system.sav folder are system files and they are safe, it is a location for many software, including system recovery. 

It is a folder generated by some OEM computer builders, most likely Hewlett Packard. 

The folder contains configuration files, utilities, all of which are useful to recover using HPâ€™s tool. I highly suggest not to to delete them.
