# What is ?

The $WINDOWS.~WS is a hidden folder created by a Windows Upgrade, typically done with Windows Updates
The $Windows.WS Windows 10/11 folder is a temporary folder that can be deleted safely. 
If this folder eats up your disk space, you can delete it. 
But since this folder contains some Windows updates, deleting the folder means that you may not be able to restore your system to the previous version
$WINDOWS.~WS folders are located at the root of the system drive, which is usually “C” drive. 
These folders are hidden by default. You need to configure the File Explorer to see them.
