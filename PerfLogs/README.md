PerfLogs (Performance Logs) is a Windows system generated folder, that stores information on system issues and performance data and logs. 

Those are used to feed performance related reports. 

The folder is typically available in your computer boot partition (typically C:\). 

It is possible to move / relocate the PerfLogs folder to a new directory, however, from disk space perspective the gains are minimal.
