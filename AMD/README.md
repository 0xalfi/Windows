# What is ?

The AMD Folder is located in the Root Directory C:\. You can safely delete that entire folder since AMD doesn't need it anymore after you run the AMD Driver package and install it.
C:\Program files\AMD is a software folder, DO NOT delete.
C:\AMD is the driver install files folder, this is SAFE to delete if you need space, but I recommend leaving the folder for the most recent 1 or 2 driver versions for quick reinstallation if necessary
it's only recommended to keep the most recent 1 or 2 driver installers as a backup incase you 

The actual install paths:
Radeon Software: C:\Program Files\AMD\CNext\CNext
Ryzen Master: C:\Program Files\AMD\RyzenMaster
Chipset Package: C:\Windows\System32\Drivers
